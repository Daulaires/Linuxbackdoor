## this is just a proof of concept. from a video I was able to learn from.
- client.py would have to be ran with the IP configured for the connection.
- persistence once ran on victims Linux/Debian Machine.
- the ip you are wanting the victim to connect to would have to either be open, or firewall would have to be configured to the ip and port.
- Worked with [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
